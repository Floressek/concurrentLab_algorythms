# Mine Simulation Project (Concurrent Programming)

## Overview ðŸŽ¯
This project simulates a tourist attraction in a salt mine, implementing concurrent programming principles to manage visitor movement and resource allocation. The simulation recreates a real-world scenario where multiple tourists navigate through a complex mine structure with specific constraints and rules.

## Detailed Project Description ðŸ“‹

### Mine Structure
The mine consists of four main chambers interconnected by passages:
- 3 standard rooms (R1, R3, R4) with capacity X visitors
- 1 larger room (R2) with capacity 2X visitors
- 2 elevators (E1, E2) for vertical transportation
- Single-person bidirectional passages connecting the rooms

## Movement Rules ðŸ“‹

1. Visitors cannot stop in passages between rooms
2. Passages are bidirectional
3. Passages allow only one person at a time
4. Visitors can pass through rooms without visiting them
5. Rooms cannot be divided into restricted access zones

## Notes ðŸ“Œ

- Each room displays a counter showing the current number of visitors
- Green paths indicate visitor routes
- Visitors can move either randomly (when visiting) or directly (when passing through)
- The Pause button changes to Resume when simulation is paused
- Multiple rapid clicks on the Restart button should be avoided to prevent unstable behavior

### Visiting Plans
The simulation supports two distinct visiting routes:
- **Plan A**: E1 â†’ R1 â†’ R2 â†’ R3 â†’ R4 â†’ E2
- **Plan B**: E2 â†’ R4 â†’ R3 â†’ R2 â†’ R1 â†’ E1

### Technical Implementation
The project utilizes modern Java concurrency features:
- Virtual threads for efficient visitor simulation
- Semaphores for room capacity management
- Synchronized blocks for critical sections
- Blocking queues for elevator management
- Event-driven GUI updates

## Key Features ðŸ”‘

### Advanced Movement System
- **Intelligent Pathfinding**: Visitors can navigate between rooms using the shortest available path
- **Dynamic Speed Adjustment**: Movement speed adapts based on congestion and room availability
- **Random/Direct Movement**: Visitors can either explore rooms randomly or move directly to exits

### Resource Management
- **Thread-Safe Room Access**: Synchronized access to prevent overcrowding
- **Smart Elevator Scheduling**: Efficient elevator algorithms to minimize wait times
- **Queue Management**: Fair queuing system for rooms and elevators

### Monitoring and Control
- **Real-time Statistics**: Displays current visitor count and room occupancy
- **Visual Feedback**: Color-coded paths and visitor states
- **Interactive Controls**: Dynamic adjustment of simulation parameters
